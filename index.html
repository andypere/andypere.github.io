            <p>I had to describe myself by using different types of fonts. The type of tool I used to create my flowers was the pen tool, it helped me create straight lines and curves by the two anchor points. As for my leafs, I clicked on the words and convert them to shape then I pressed  edit and clicked on Warp. So I was able to make my fonts shape like leafs. The words describe how I enjoy life, learning, or how I am still developing to become a professional web designer.<br><br></p>

            <p>   As you can see, I created a good looking donut poster for my school called Thomas Edison. I used the elliptical marquee tool to helped me created a huge circle in the middle of the document. Then I used the subtraction selection tool to make a smaller circle in the middle which created my donut hole. After that I saved my selection and I used the subtraction tool again to created a bite mark in my yummy donut.<br><br> </p>

            <p> This is  I add pattern and tried to make it symmetrical as possible. I also edit the photo in only non-destructive way. To make it look more appealing I added clipping mask and  blending mode (multiply) to make the image fit perfectly in the shoes. The most challenging part was to make them all even.</p>

            <p> In class, we pretended Victor Cruz has approached to Thomas Edison and our job is to create his newest and greatest sneakers. The color I have chosen is unique and shows how cool and relax you are. This time I used the magic wand to add color. Then I used many layers in case I change my mind on the type of color I used. Using the magic wand tool is so helpful, it help me choose exactly the type of size to color in. I usually used solid and pattern colors and I'm happy how it turned out.This was my second time creating a new sneaker design.<br><br></p>

            <p> My newest creation I made so far is Mr. Potato Head! To attached all the fruits and vegetable to make a nice looking face in front of his face, I had to use different kind of tools. I had to used the marquee tool, lasso tools, and quick mask tools to be able to cut out all the elements. Also my fruits and vegetable aren't squish because I went to the application bar and  used free transformation to shifts the images.My funny looking potato head is complete!<br><br> </p>
